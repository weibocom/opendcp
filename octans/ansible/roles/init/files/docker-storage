# This file may be automatically generated by an installation program.

# By default, Docker uses a loopback-mounted sparse file in
# /var/lib/docker.  The loopback makes it slower, and there are some
# restrictive defaults, such as 100GB max storage.

# If your installation did not set a custom storage for Docker, you
# may do it below.

# Example: Use a custom pair of raw logical volumes (one for metadata,
# one for data).
